ELK Stack Installation Guide
===========================

Prerequisites:
-------------
1. Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
   For Windows:
   - Install Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
   
   For Ubuntu Linux:
   - Install Docker:
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install docker.io
   - Install Docker Compose:
     sudo apt install docker-compose
   - Add your user to the docker group:
     sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
     # Log out and back in for the group changes to take effect

2. Python 3.x installed
   For Ubuntu Linux:
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

3. Git (optional, for cloning the repository)
   For Ubuntu Linux:
   sudo apt install git

Step 1: Start Docker
-------------------
For Windows:
1. Open Docker Desktop application
2. Wait for it to fully start (you'll see the whale icon in your system tray)
3. Make sure Docker is running by opening a terminal and typing:
   docker --version

For Ubuntu Linux:
1. Start Docker service:
   sudo systemctl start docker
2. Enable Docker to start on boot:
   sudo systemctl enable docker
3. Verify Docker is running:
   docker --version

Step 2: Start the ELK Stack
--------------------------
1. Open a terminal in the project directory
2. Run the following command to start all ELK components:
   docker-compose up -d
3. Wait a few minutes for all services to start properly

Step 3: Install Python Dependencies
---------------------------------
1. In the same terminal, install the required Python packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # On Ubuntu, you might need to use:
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Step 4: Run the Sample Log Generator
----------------------------------
1. Start the log generator:
   python sample_logs.py
   # On Ubuntu, you might need to use:
   python3 sample_logs.py
2. The script will start sending sample logs to Logstash
3. Keep this terminal window open while you're working with ELK

Step 5: Access Kibana
--------------------
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to http://localhost:5601
3. When Kibana loads for the first time:
   - Click "Explore on my own" or "Get started"
   - Go to "Stack Management" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Index Patterns"
   - Click "Create index pattern"
   - Enter "logstash-*" as the pattern
   - Select "@timestamp" as the time field
   - Click "Create index pattern"

Step 6: Verify Everything is Working
----------------------------------
1. In Kibana, go to "Discover" in the left sidebar
2. You should see logs appearing in real-time
3. Each log entry should contain:
   - timestamp
   - user
   - action
   - status_code
   - duration_ms
   - host

Troubleshooting:
---------------
1. If Docker containers aren't starting:
   For Windows:
   - Check if Docker Desktop is running
   - Try restarting Docker Desktop
   
   For Ubuntu:
   - Check Docker service status:
     sudo systemctl status docker
   - Restart Docker service:
     sudo systemctl restart docker
   
   For both:
   - Check the logs with: docker-compose logs

2. If logs aren't appearing in Kibana:
   - Make sure the log generator is running
   - Check if Logstash is running: docker-compose ps
   - Verify the index pattern is created correctly

3. If you can't access Kibana:
   - Make sure port 5601 isn't being used by another application
   - Check if the Kibana container is running: docker-compose ps
   - For Ubuntu, check if the port is open:
     sudo ufw status

Stopping the Stack:
------------------
1. To stop the log generator:
   - Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running

2. To stop the ELK stack:
   docker-compose down

3. To stop Docker:
   For Windows:
   - Right-click the Docker icon in the system tray
   - Select "Quit Docker Desktop"
   
   For Ubuntu:
   - sudo systemctl stop docker
